CineVid is an experimental swift and AVFoundation Based HDR multi frame capture system. It works similar to the Majic Lantern Firmware for Canon DLSR cameras in that it takes sequences of different iso images.
Unfortunately the hardware or operating sytem (I was using iOS7 at the time) was unable to reliably switch ISO values. It works about 99% of the time, but that 1% breaks the whole project.
Perhaps with the latest iPhone and iOS 9.01 software it might work but I've not tried it yet.
